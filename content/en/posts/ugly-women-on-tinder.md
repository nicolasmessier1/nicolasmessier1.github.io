### Observation report

Ugly women on Tinder have the advantage of being able to sleep with guys much better looking than her.

  
This is due to Tinder's algorithm and the fact that there are also more men than women on Tinder. So men have less choice and are less picky about getting sex.

Women, on the other hand, have a choice.

A 3/10 can sleep with an 8/10. Something she could not do IRL or with difficulty.

This will create a problem when they want to be in a relationship.

They will have a string of attractive guys, but they will not want to go further.

Because once the man has slept with the ugly one, he will not want to couple with her, he does not see himself introducing the ugly one to his parents and friends, especially if he knows her value.

The only purpose of sleeping with an ugly woman for the man is to satisfy his sexual needs. (The first level in Maslow's pyramid: Physiological needs).

The ugly girls on Tinder who will try to find love to satisfy their Needs of belonging and love (3rd level of Maslow's pyramid), will always make the same mistake, the fact of having slept with beautiful guys will make her believe that she has a higher value than reality.

She will reject the 3 or 4 out of 10 who are at the same level as her, because she will think she has a higher value (she sleeps with 8/10 guys so she must have value in her head).

This kind of woman if she doesn't question herself will always repeat the same mistake. They will end up saying that all men are the same: that they just want sex, that they are assholes. And in some cases, they will end up hating men, like some extreme feminists.

The same problem appears with men, but on the contrary, if they are not part of the 20% of the most beautiful men, they will have big difficulties on Tinder.

A 7/10 man may not have a match or women will not respond to him, because there is always another better looking and richer guy on Tinder, so why would the woman take the 7/10 (women are in abundance on Tinder thanks to the imbalance of men and women on the application).

The man can lose confidence in himself, because even ugly women don't match with him while he sees thousands of women's profiles.

This can lead to frustration, depression, anger against women, even hatred.

## Conclusion

Ugly and average women can use Tinder to have sex with good looking guys, but they should not forget their value when they want to pair up, a fat woman will never pair up with a man who works out and takes care of himself (even if she manages to sleep with him).

For a man who is not in the top 20%, Tinder is a waste of time, and it can affect his mental health and make him lose confidence. The best thing to do is to avoid Tinder and meet people in real life, for example: at parties, events, sports, etc ... and use the time to develop (physically, mentally and financially), it will become more attractive.
